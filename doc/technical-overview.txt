* Browse hierarchical external content source from the SilverStripe backend
* Browse external content directly from a page within a SilverStripe website,
presenting that content in SilverStripe themes. 
* Link to external content from normal SilverStripe WYSIWYG content blocks
* Import content from an external source into native SilverStripe formats

== Backend 'External Content Administration' Components == 

=== ExternalContentAdmin ===

The main backend container for various remote content providers. 

=== ExternalContentSource ===

Abstraction of a connector that provides access to a remote data source.
It should define a method such as 'getRepo' or 'getSource' which will 
return an object with an API for retrieving information from the external 
source. 

=== ExternalContentItem ===

A wrapper around content sourced from a remote system. An external 
content item contains a 'remoteProperties' array and custom implementations
of __get and __set that read and write properties into this array. It
is up to the specific external content item implementations to provide
mappings between the remote data item and this array (or an alternative
if so desired). 
Typically, an ExternalContentItem should be passed its parent 
ExernalContentSource when created. It can then use the ExternalContentSource's
'getRepo' method for retrieving the object that actually implements the 
remote content source data retrieval API.

== Migration Components == 


=== ExternalContentImporter ===

Implementations should provide a specific content importer class that is used
for determining what transformations are supported for each remote content
type. 

=== ExternalContentTransformer ===

Implementations should define a mapping between an ExternalContentItem and
a SilverStripe DataObject (page or file). It must return a TransformResult
object that contains the newly created page (used for hierarchical import) and
the list of child objects that should also be imported. 
The transformer is responsible for dictating which children should be imported
due to some children being imported in the context of its parent, and not
requiring a standalone representation in SilverStripe (for example). There
may be other instances in which the child of a content item should not be
imported. 

----

== SiteTree Components == 

=== ExternalContentPage ===

A page type that is connected to a remote content source, or a specific remote
content item. In templates, the remote content source is available via the
$ContentItem variable. From this, all remote metadata properties are 
available, as well as access to the remote children of the remote content
object.  

Additionally, there are properties such as $DownloadLink, which will return a 
URL that streams the external content directly to the browser. 

The ExternalContentPage serves as an example page type for iterating external
content items.   

=== ExternalTreeDropdownField ===

A custom TreeDropdownField that is capable of handling the composite IDs that
the external content sources provide from the remote system. 

=== ExternalHtmlEditorField_Toolbar ===

A custom toolbar for the wysiwyg editor that allows for creating links to 
external content sources.

== Supplementary Libraries ==

=== SeaMist ===

The beginnings of a generic CMIS interface library for PHP. Currently, only 
the following section of the CMIS api is implemented for Alfresco

* getRepositoryInfo
* getProperties
* getChildren

A SeaMistRepository returns either SeaMistObjects, which map to a single
'entry' element in Atom, or a SeaMistObjectList which maps to a 
'feed' element in an Atom feed (a list of 'entry' elements). Further work may
be done to support SOAP based creation of SeaMistObjects and abstracting the
existing class definitions to interfaces with impls such as 
  
  class AtomSeaMistObject implements SeaMistObject
  
instead. 

There is an implementation of the Alfresco CMIS API that makes use of the 
webscript base APIs for retrieving the relevant content, via the WebApiClient

=== WebApiClient ===

The WebApiClient provides URL based RPC where the response is mapped back to
some form of relevant data. The WebApiClient requires a list of defined methods
in the form

	$methods = array (
		'methodName' => array(
			'url' => '/path/at/remote/url',
			'params' => array('param', 'names'),
			'return' => 'xml',
			'cache' => 60,
		)
	);

See the WebApiClient class for a list of supported information for a method. 

To call a remote method

	$api = new WebApiClient($remoteUrlBase, $methodDefinitions)
	$api->callMethod('methodName', array('param1' => 'value', 'param2' => 'value2'));

For example, imagine that
there is a "login" method that can be called on a particular URL with some 
parameters, with an XML return type. A definition of this method would look like

	'login' => array(
		'url' => '/api/login',
		'return' => 'xml',
		'params' => array('u', 'pw'),
		'cache' => false,
	),

Then, it is simply a matter of calling

	$apiClient->callMethod('login', array('u' => 'user', 'pw' => 'pass'))
	
The return of a method call is determined by the 'return' parameter defined in
the method definition. This is mapped to a 'ReturnHandler' implementation that
takes the raw response from the method call and attemps to transform it into 
a certain kind of object. For example, the XmlReturnHandler converts responses
into a SimpleXML object, whereas the JsonReturnHandler converts a raw response
via the json_decode method to a raw stdClass object.
